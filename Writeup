Solutions & Methodologies

1. Cipher Suite Extraction

Solution: ***************

Methodology:

· Filter: frame.number == 12
· Navigate to: TLS → Handshake Protocol: Server Hello → Cipher Suite
· The Base64-encoded answer decodes to reveal the actual cipher suite name

2. Fragmented HTTP PID Parameter

Solution: **********

Methodology:

· Filter: http.request.uri contains "tomshardware"
· Follow TCP Stream to reassemble fragmented request
· Extract PID parameter from: /xhr.2379762202539.js?PID=...
· Base64 decoding the provided string reveals the UUID

3. TLS Application Data Rate

Solution: *** packets/second average

Methodology:

· I/O Graph filter: tls.record.content_type == 23
· Time range: 0-5 seconds
· Calculate: Total Application Data packets (7) / 5 seconds = 1.4 packets/sec

4. Ghost Segment Analysis

Solution: ****

Methodology:

· Filter: tcp.stream eq 0 && tcp.analysis.ack_lost_segment
· Frame 14 shows Acknowledgment number: 2777
· This acknowledges data that was sent but not captured

5. Compromised TLS Random

Solution: **********

Methodology:

· Filter: tls.handshake.type == 1
· Frame 9 Client Hello → Random → GMT Unix Time: 29778374
· Weak random values compromise TLS security

6. Illegal Window Scaling

Solution: *

Methodology:

· Filter: tcp.options.wscale.shift
· RFC 1323 specifies maximum shift count of 14
· The value 9 is actually legal - the challenge contained a trick question

7. Statistical Anomaly

Solution: ***


Methodology:

· Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy
· POP shows 0.000% packets but contains critical credentials
· Demonstrates impact ≠ volume in security analysis

8. Multicast Paradox

Solution: SSDP_MULTICAST

Methodology:

· I/O Graph shows regular 30-second spikes from 192.168.0.50
· Conversations statistics shows only 3 packets from same host
· Explanation: SSDP multicast packets counted differently in each feature
